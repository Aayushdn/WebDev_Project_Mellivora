            I’ve been skiing since I was nine and travelled the world chasing
            great slopes, but nothing tops last summer in the Roaring Fork
            Valley. Aspen was easy to reach — the airport’s ten minutes away,
            and free buses link all four mountains: Ajax, Snowmass, Aspen
            Highlands, and Buttermilk. These slopes were no walk in the park,
            with steep pitches and long runs that kept me sharp. Hiking Highland
            Bowl and carving down Ruthie’s Run were unforgettable. Each mountain
            had its own vibe — Snowmass wide and open, Ajax classic and fast,
            Buttermilk smooth to finish the week. Evenings at Ajax Tavern or The
            Red Onion wrapped up perfect days in the Rockies.

            I thought I knew snow until I rode in Niseko. The powder is unreal —
            light, dry, and endless. Every morning brought fresh tracks under
            Mount Yōtei’s shadow, with easy shuttles between Grand Hirafu,
            Hanazono, and Annupuri. The tree runs were pure joy, and the locals
            couldn’t be more welcoming. After a long day, soaking in an onsen
            while snow fell was unbeatable. Niseko isn’t just a resort — it’s a
            rhythm of snow, food, and warmth that stays with you.

            Chamonix is the Alps at their best — rugged, dramatic, and alive
            with history. Standing atop the Aiguille du Midi, staring at Mont
            Blanc, was unforgettable. The Vallée Blanche run tested every skill
            I had, and the town’s energy is electric. Mornings at Elevation
            1904, evenings at La Terrasse — everything revolves around
            adventure. Chamonix isn’t just a trip; it’s a milestone for anyone
            who lives for the mountains.
